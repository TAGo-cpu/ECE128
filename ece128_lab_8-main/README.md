# ECE 128 Lab 8 README File


## Project Description
This lab involves the Verilog implementation of RAM and ROM. These are fundamental concepts of memory in Computer Engineering and hardware design. The lab explores the differences between RAM and ROM and how they are implemented as modules in Verilog. Testbenches are created to understand their behavior through sequential and combinational programming. 

## How to simulate the program and implement it on the FPGA 
To simulate the program, ensure that each model file is located in the design sources and the testbench file is in the simulation sources directory. Since there are multiple modules and testbenches, make sure the modules you want to simulate are set to the top in Vivado. To run the simulation, go to the navigator on the left side of Vivado and click run simulation, then run behavioral simulation to output the waveforms of the testbench. 

Because RAM and ROM are memory modules, they do not involve any hardware implementation and are not programmed onto the board.
